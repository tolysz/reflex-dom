## Reflex-DOM
### A Framework for Functional Reactive Web Apps in Haskell

Reflex-DOM is a framework for building web applications in Haskell, based on the [Functional Reactive Programming](https://wiki.haskell.org/Functional_Reactive_Programming) library [Reflex](https://github.com/ryantrinkle/reflex).

Comprehensive documentation is still a work in progress, but a [demo](https://github.com/ryantrinkle/try-reflex) is available and an introductory talk is available at [Part 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvkcskJbc4) / [Part 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qfc9XFVo2c) ([Slides](https://obsidian.systems/reflex-nyhug/)).

A summary of Reflex-DOM functions is available in the [quick reference](Quickref.md).
